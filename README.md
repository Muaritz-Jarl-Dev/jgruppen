This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables Setup

This project requires Firebase configuration. Before starting the development server:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update the `.env` file with your Firebase project credentials

**Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed to version control as it contains sensitive API keys.

### Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
